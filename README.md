Brief Explanation of the Code
This program processes a list of numbers entered by the user to:

Separate Even and Odd Numbers: It divides the numbers into two listsâ€”one for even numbers and one for odd numbers.
Calculate Sums: It calculates the sum of even and odd numbers separately.
Steps Explained
Input and Conversion:

The user enters a space-separated list of numbers.
These numbers are converted into a list of integers.
Mapping:

A map operation processes each number (though here, it's a simple identity operation).
Filtering:

Even Numbers: Filters out numbers divisible by 2 into a separate list.
Odd Numbers: Filters out numbers that are not divisible by 2 into another list.
Summation:

Uses the reduce function to calculate:

Sum of Even Numbers
Sum of Odd Numbers
Output:

Prints:

The original list.
The list of even numbers.
The list of odd numbers.
The total sum of even numbers.
The total sum of odd numbers.

Purpose:

This program demonstrates functional programming techniques in Python using map, filter, and reduce to manipulate and analyze numerical data effectively.
